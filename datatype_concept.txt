1. there are two types of data types 

    -> primitive
       
       - number --> use to store numeric value

       - string --> use to store character, words

       - boolean --> true or false, occured or not occured, 0 or 1, follow or not follow

       - undefined --> value is not defined, no value yet

       - null --> intentionally empty, Show nothing on the screen, commonly used when you want to  remove a component from the UI.

       (Both undefined and null render nothing, but null is clearer in intent.)

       - bigint --> used to store very large numbers that number cannot handle safely, 

       - symbol -->

       - NaN (not a number): 0/0 type of this is NaN (not valid) 

    -> non-primitive

       - objects --> contains variables, store data in key value pair
